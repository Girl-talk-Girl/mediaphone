<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Facts and Figures: Ending Violence against Women</b></span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">According to a 2013 global review of available data, 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence. However, some national violence studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime from an intimate partner [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">1</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">It is estimated that of all women killed in 2012, almost half were killed by intimate partners or family members [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">2</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">More often than not, cases of violence against women go unreported. For instance, a study based on interviews with 42,000 women across the 28 Member States of the European Union revealed that only 14 per cent of women reported their most serious incident of intimate partner violence to the police, and 13 per cent reported their most serious incident of non-partner violence to the police [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">3</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Worldwide, more than 700 million women alive today were married as children (below 18 years of age). More than one in three—or some 250 million—were married before 15. Child brides are often unable to effectively negotiate safer sex, leaving themselves vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, along with early pregnancy. The fact that girls are not physically mature enough to give birth, places both mothers and their babies at risk. Poor girls are also 2.5 times more likely to marry in childhood than those living in the wealthiest quintile [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">4</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Among ever-married girls, current and/or former intimate partners are the most commonly reported perpetrators of physical violence in all the countries with available data [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">5</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Around 120 million girls worldwide (slightly more than 1 in 10) have experienced forced intercourse or other forced sexual acts at some point in their lives [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">6</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">More than 133 million girls and women have experienced some form of female genital mutilation (FGM) in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where the harmful practice is most common. Beyond extreme physical and psychological pain, girls who undergo FGM are at risk of prolonged bleeding, infection (including HIV), infertility, complications during pregnancy and death [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">7</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Trafficking ensnares millions of women and girls in modern-day slavery. Women and girls represent 55 per cent of the estimated 20.9 million victims of forced labour worldwide, and 98 per cent of the estimated 4.5 million forced into sexual exploitation [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">8</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Between 40 and 50 per cent of women in European Union countries experience unwanted sexual advances, physical contact or other forms of sexual harassment at work [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">9</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">In the United States, 83 per cent of girls in grades 8 through 11 (aged 12 to 16) have experienced some form of sexual harassment in public schools [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">10</span></a>].</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Extra vulnerabilities</b></span></p>
<ul>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Women in urban areas are twice as likely as men to experience violence, particularly in developing countries [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">11</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">In New Delhi, a 2010 study found that 66 per cent of women reported experiencing sexual harassment between two and five times during the past year [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">12</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Research conducted in different countries has documented associations between HIV and physical and/or sexual violence, both as a risk factor for HIV infection and as a potential consequence of being identified as living with HIV [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">13</span></a>]. A decade of cross-sectional research from African countries, including Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa and more recently, India, has consistently found women who have experienced partner violence to be more likely to be infected with HIV [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">14</span></a>].</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">In the United States, 11.8 per cent of new HIV infections among women more than 20 years old during the previous year were attributed to intimate partner violence [<a href="http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures"><span class="s4">15</span></a>].</span></li>
